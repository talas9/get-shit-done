<purpose>
Execute all plans in a phase using wave-based parallel execution. Orchestrator stays lean — delegates plan execution to subagents.
</purpose>

<core_principle>
Orchestrator coordinates, not executes. Each subagent loads the full execute-plan context. Orchestrator: discover plans → analyze deps → group waves → spawn agents → handle checkpoints → collect results.
</core_principle>

<required_reading>
Read STATE.md before any operation to load project context.
</required_reading>

<process>

<step name="initialize" priority="first">
Load all context in one call:

```bash
INIT=$(node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" init execute-phase "${PHASE_ARG}")
if [[ "$INIT" == @file:* ]]; then INIT=$(cat "${INIT#@file:}"); fi
```

Parse JSON for: `executor_model`, `verifier_model`, `commit_docs`, `parallelization`, `hierarchy_enabled`, `hierarchy_max_l2_agents`, `branching_strategy`, `branch_name`, `phase_found`, `phase_dir`, `phase_number`, `phase_name`, `phase_slug`, `plans`, `incomplete_plans`, `plan_count`, `incomplete_count`, `state_exists`, `roadmap_exists`, `phase_req_ids`.

**If `phase_found` is false:** Error — phase directory not found.
**If `plan_count` is 0:** Error — no plans found in phase.
**If `state_exists` is false but `.planning/` exists:** Offer reconstruct or continue.

When `parallelization` is false, plans within a wave execute sequentially.

**Sync chain flag with intent** — if user invoked manually (no `--auto`), clear the ephemeral chain flag from any previous interrupted `--auto` chain. This does NOT touch `workflow.auto_advance` (the user's persistent settings preference). Must happen before any config reads (checkpoint handling also reads auto-advance flags):
```bash
if [[ ! "$ARGUMENTS" =~ --auto ]]; then
  node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" config-set workflow._auto_chain_active false 2>/dev/null
fi
```
</step>

<step name="handle_branching">
Check `branching_strategy` from init:

**"none":** Skip, continue on current branch.

**"phase" or "milestone":** Use pre-computed `branch_name` from init:
```bash
git checkout -b "$BRANCH_NAME" 2>/dev/null || git checkout "$BRANCH_NAME"
```

All subsequent commits go to this branch. User handles merging.
</step>

<step name="validate_phase">
From init JSON: `phase_dir`, `plan_count`, `incomplete_count`.

Report: "Found {plan_count} plans in {phase_dir} ({incomplete_count} incomplete)"
</step>

<step name="discover_and_group_plans">
Load plan inventory with wave grouping in one call:

```bash
PLAN_INDEX=$(node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" phase-plan-index "${PHASE_NUMBER}")
```

Parse JSON for: `phase`, `plans[]` (each with `id`, `wave`, `autonomous`, `objective`, `files_modified`, `task_count`, `has_summary`), `waves` (map of wave number → plan IDs), `incomplete`, `has_checkpoints`.

**Filtering:** Skip plans where `has_summary: true`. If `--gaps-only`: also skip non-gap_closure plans. If all filtered: "No matching incomplete plans" → exit.

Report:
```
## Execution Plan

**Phase {X}: {Name}** — {total_plans} plans across {wave_count} waves

| Wave | Plans | What it builds |
|------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | 01-01, 01-02 | {from plan objectives, 3-8 words} |
| 2 | 01-03 | ... |
```
</step>

<step name="hierarchy_dispatch">
Conditionally route execution through L2 sub-orchestrator streams when hierarchy mode is active.

**Condition gate:**

```
IF PARALLELIZATION == true AND HIERARCHY_ENABLED == true:
  → hierarchy path (steps 1–6 below)
ELSE:
  → skip to execute_waves (unchanged flat path)
```

---

**Step 1 — Spawn partitioner to get stream map:**

Spawn `gsd-partitioner` agent via Task() to partition the phase plans into parallel streams:

```
Task(
  subagent_type="gsd-partitioner",
  prompt="<phase_dir>{phase_dir}</phase_dir>"
)
```

Parse the returned JSON for the `streams` array. If any of the following occur, log the reason and skip to `execute_waves`:

- Partitioner fails or returns an error
- Returned `streams` array is empty
- Returned `streams` array contains exactly 1 stream (no parallelism benefit — Claude's Discretion optimization)

```
Hierarchy: {reason} — using flat execution mode
```

---

**Step 2 — Create worktrees (track created list for cleanup):**

For each stream in the partition output, create a dedicated git worktree:

```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" worktree-create {stream.name}
```

Parse the returned JSON for `path` and `branch` fields. Convert the relative `path` to an absolute path:

```bash
PROJECT_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
WORKTREE_ABS_PATH="${PROJECT_ROOT}/{path}"
```

Track all successfully created worktree names in a list for cleanup on partial failure. If ANY `worktree-create` call fails:

1. Run `worktree-remove {name}` for every already-created worktree
2. Notify: "Hierarchy: worktree-create failed for {stream.name} — using flat execution mode"
3. Skip to `execute_waves`

---

**Step 3 — Spawn L2 sub-orchestrators:**

Report what's being dispatched before spawning:

```
## Hierarchy Dispatch
Spawning {N} L2 sub-orchestrators across {N} worktree streams...
- Stream {name}: {plan_count} plans → {absolute_worktree_path}
```

Spawn ALL L2s before waiting for any results. L1 must never block on a single L2 (DISP-02). Use Task() standalone subagent — do NOT use TeamCreate (bug #32731):

```
Task(
  subagent_type="gsd-sub-orchestrator",
  run_in_background=true,
  prompt="
    <worktree>{absolute_worktree_path}</worktree>
    <phase>{phase_slug}</phase>
    <phase_dir>{phase_dir}</phase_dir>
    <stream>{ \"name\": \"{stream.name}\", \"plans\": [{plan_list}] }</stream>
  "
)
```

Spawn one Task() call per stream before waiting on any of them. After all are spawned, wait for all background tasks to complete.

---

**Step 4 — Wait for completion and verify:**

After all background L2 tasks complete, read each return value. Parse for the completion prefix:

- `STREAM_COMPLETE: {name}` — stream succeeded
- `STREAM_FAILED: {name}` — stream failed

Secondary verification: for each plan in each stream, check that the SUMMARY.md exists on disk:

```bash
ls {worktree_path}/.planning/phases/{phase_dir}/{phase}-{plan}-SUMMARY.md
```

If ANY L2 returns `STREAM_FAILED` OR a SUMMARY.md is missing for a plan that should have completed:

1. Report which stream/plan failed
2. Run `worktree-remove {name}` for ALL created worktrees
3. Notify: "Hierarchy: stream {name} failed — falling back to flat execution mode"
4. Skip to `execute_waves`

---

**Step 5 — Merge worktrees to main:**

For each stream (in order), merge its branch into the current branch:

```bash
git merge {worktree_branch} --no-ff -m "merge(hierarchy): stream {stream_name} into main"
```

If a merge conflict occurs: notify the user and STOP — do NOT fall back to flat execution. Plans have already been executed in the worktrees; re-executing them in flat mode would double-run them.

```
## Merge Conflict: stream {name}

Stream {name} has a merge conflict that requires manual resolution.
Plans in this stream were already executed — do not re-run them.

Resolve the conflict with standard git tools, then continue.
```

---

**Step 6 — Reconcile state and cleanup:**

CRITICAL ORDER: call `state-reconcile` BEFORE `worktree-remove`. The reconcile step reads the worktree registry — remove clears that registry.

```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" state-reconcile
```

Then remove each worktree:

```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" worktree-remove {stream_name}
```

Commit the reconciled state:

```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" commit "docs(phase-{X}): reconcile hierarchy execution" --files .planning/STATE.md .planning/worktree-registry.json
```

After successful merge and cleanup, skip `execute_waves` — plans are already executed — and proceed directly to `aggregate_results`.

---

**Fallback pattern summary (DISP-06):**

All pre-execution fallback paths (Steps 1–4 failures) follow the same pattern:
1. Clean up any created worktrees: `worktree-remove {name}` for each in the tracked list
2. Notify: "Hierarchy execution failed at {step}. Falling back to flat execution mode."
3. Proceed to `execute_waves` with the same plan inventory, unchanged

Post-execution failures (merge conflicts in Step 5) do NOT fall back — they stop and require manual resolution.

**Anti-patterns:**
- Do NOT read `hierarchy.enabled` directly from config.json — use INIT JSON output only
- Do NOT use TeamCreate for L2 spawning — use Task() standalone subagent (bug #32731)
- Do NOT call `state-reconcile` after `worktree-remove` — reconcile reads the registry that remove clears
- Do NOT use relative worktree paths in L2 prompt — convert to absolute via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
- Do NOT fall back to flat after a merge conflict — plans already executed, flat would double-run them
</step>

<step name="execute_waves">
Execute each wave in sequence. Within a wave: parallel if `PARALLELIZATION=true`, sequential if `false`.

**For each wave:**

1. **Describe what's being built (BEFORE spawning):**

   Read each plan's `<objective>`. Extract what's being built and why.

   ```
   ---
   ## Wave {N}

   **{Plan ID}: {Plan Name}**
   {2-3 sentences: what this builds, technical approach, why it matters}

   Spawning {count} agent(s)...
   ---
   ```

   - Bad: "Executing terrain generation plan"
   - Good: "Procedural terrain generator using Perlin noise — creates height maps, biome zones, and collision meshes. Required before vehicle physics can interact with ground."

2. **Spawn executor agents:**

   Pass paths only — executors read files themselves with their fresh 200k context.
   This keeps orchestrator context lean (~10-15%).

   ```
   Task(
     subagent_type="gsd-executor",
     model="{executor_model}",
     prompt="
       <objective>
       Execute plan {plan_number} of phase {phase_number}-{phase_name}.
       Commit each task atomically. Create SUMMARY.md. Update STATE.md and ROADMAP.md.
       </objective>

       <execution_context>
       @~/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/execute-plan.md
       @~/.claude/get-shit-done/templates/summary.md
       @~/.claude/get-shit-done/references/checkpoints.md
       @~/.claude/get-shit-done/references/tdd.md
       </execution_context>

       <files_to_read>
       Read these files at execution start using the Read tool:
       - {phase_dir}/{plan_file} (Plan)
       - .planning/STATE.md (State)
       - .planning/config.json (Config, if exists)
       - ./CLAUDE.md (Project instructions, if exists — follow project-specific guidelines and coding conventions)
       - .claude/skills/ or .agents/skills/ (Project skills, if either exists — list skills, read SKILL.md for each, follow relevant rules during implementation)
       </files_to_read>

       <success_criteria>
       - [ ] All tasks executed
       - [ ] Each task committed individually
       - [ ] SUMMARY.md created in plan directory
       - [ ] STATE.md updated with position and decisions
       - [ ] ROADMAP.md updated with plan progress (via `roadmap update-plan-progress`)
       </success_criteria>
     "
   )
   ```

3. **Wait for all agents in wave to complete.**

4. **Report completion — spot-check claims first:**

   For each SUMMARY.md:
   - Verify first 2 files from `key-files.created` exist on disk
   - Check `git log --oneline --all --grep="{phase}-{plan}"` returns ≥1 commit
   - Check for `## Self-Check: FAILED` marker

   If ANY spot-check fails: report which plan failed, route to failure handler — ask "Retry plan?" or "Continue with remaining waves?"

   If pass:
   ```
   ---
   ## Wave {N} Complete

   **{Plan ID}: {Plan Name}**
   {What was built — from SUMMARY.md}
   {Notable deviations, if any}

   {If more waves: what this enables for next wave}
   ---
   ```

   - Bad: "Wave 2 complete. Proceeding to Wave 3."
   - Good: "Terrain system complete — 3 biome types, height-based texturing, physics collision meshes. Vehicle physics (Wave 3) can now reference ground surfaces."

5. **Handle failures:**

   **Known Claude Code bug (classifyHandoffIfNeeded):** If an agent reports "failed" with error containing `classifyHandoffIfNeeded is not defined`, this is a Claude Code runtime bug — not a GSD or agent issue. The error fires in the completion handler AFTER all tool calls finish. In this case: run the same spot-checks as step 4 (SUMMARY.md exists, git commits present, no Self-Check: FAILED). If spot-checks PASS → treat as **successful**. If spot-checks FAIL → treat as real failure below.

   For real failures: report which plan failed → ask "Continue?" or "Stop?" → if continue, dependent plans may also fail. If stop, partial completion report.

6. **Execute checkpoint plans between waves** — see `<checkpoint_handling>`.

7. **Proceed to next wave.**
</step>

<step name="checkpoint_handling">
Plans with `autonomous: false` require user interaction.

**Auto-mode checkpoint handling:**

Read auto-advance config (chain flag + user preference):
```bash
AUTO_CHAIN=$(node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" config-get workflow._auto_chain_active 2>/dev/null || echo "false")
AUTO_CFG=$(node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" config-get workflow.auto_advance 2>/dev/null || echo "false")
```

When executor returns a checkpoint AND (`AUTO_CHAIN` is `"true"` OR `AUTO_CFG` is `"true"`):
- **human-verify** → Auto-spawn continuation agent with `{user_response}` = `"approved"`. Log `⚡ Auto-approved checkpoint`.
- **decision** → Auto-spawn continuation agent with `{user_response}` = first option from checkpoint details. Log `⚡ Auto-selected: [option]`.
- **human-action** → Present to user (existing behavior below). Auth gates cannot be automated.

**Standard flow (not auto-mode, or human-action type):**

1. Spawn agent for checkpoint plan
2. Agent runs until checkpoint task or auth gate → returns structured state
3. Agent return includes: completed tasks table, current task + blocker, checkpoint type/details, what's awaited
4. **Present to user:**
   ```
   ## Checkpoint: [Type]

   **Plan:** 03-03 Dashboard Layout
   **Progress:** 2/3 tasks complete

   [Checkpoint Details from agent return]
   [Awaiting section from agent return]
   ```
5. User responds: "approved"/"done" | issue description | decision selection
6. **Spawn continuation agent (NOT resume)** using continuation-prompt.md template:
   - `{completed_tasks_table}`: From checkpoint return
   - `{resume_task_number}` + `{resume_task_name}`: Current task
   - `{user_response}`: What user provided
   - `{resume_instructions}`: Based on checkpoint type
7. Continuation agent verifies previous commits, continues from resume point
8. Repeat until plan completes or user stops

**Why fresh agent, not resume:** Resume relies on internal serialization that breaks with parallel tool calls. Fresh agents with explicit state are more reliable.

**Checkpoints in parallel waves:** Agent pauses and returns while other parallel agents may complete. Present checkpoint, spawn continuation, wait for all before next wave.

<step name="close_parent_artifacts">
**For decimal/polish phases only (X.Y pattern):** Close the feedback loop by resolving parent UAT and debug artifacts.

**Skip if** phase number has no decimal (e.g., `3`, `04`) — only applies to gap-closure phases like `4.1`, `03.1`.

**1. Detect decimal phase and derive parent:**
```bash
# Check if phase_number contains a decimal
if [[ "$PHASE_NUMBER" == *.* ]]; then
  PARENT_PHASE="${PHASE_NUMBER%%.*}"
fi
```

**2. Find parent UAT file:**
```bash
PARENT_INFO=$(node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" find-phase "${PARENT_PHASE}" --raw)
# Extract directory from PARENT_INFO JSON, then find UAT file in that directory
```

**If no parent UAT found:** Skip this step (gap-closure may have been triggered by VERIFICATION.md instead).

**3. Update UAT gap statuses:**

Read the parent UAT file's `## Gaps` section. For each gap entry with `status: failed`:
- Update to `status: resolved`

**4. Update UAT frontmatter:**

If all gaps now have `status: resolved`:
- Update frontmatter `status: diagnosed` → `status: resolved`
- Update frontmatter `updated:` timestamp

**5. Resolve referenced debug sessions:**

For each gap that has a `debug_session:` field:
- Read the debug session file
- Update frontmatter `status:` → `resolved`
- Update frontmatter `updated:` timestamp
- Move to resolved directory:
```bash
mkdir -p .planning/debug/resolved
mv .planning/debug/{slug}.md .planning/debug/resolved/
```

**6. Commit updated artifacts:**
```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" commit "docs(phase-${PARENT_PHASE}): resolve UAT gaps and debug sessions after ${PHASE_NUMBER} gap closure" --files .planning/phases/*${PARENT_PHASE}*/*-UAT.md .planning/debug/resolved/*.md

**Exception:** If `gaps_found`, the `verify_phase_goal` step already presents the gap-closure path (`/gsd:plan-phase {X} --gaps`). No additional routing needed — skip auto-advance.

**No-transition check (spawned by auto-advance chain):**

Parse `--no-transition` flag from $ARGUMENTS.

**If `--no-transition` flag present:**

Execute-phase was spawned by plan-phase's auto-advance. Do NOT run transition.md.

```

STOP. Do not proceed to auto-advance or transition.

**If `--no-transition` flag is NOT present:**

**Auto-advance detection:**

1. Parse `--auto` flag from $ARGUMENTS
2. Read both the chain flag and user preference (chain flag already synced in init step):

Execute the transition workflow inline (do NOT use Task — orchestrator context is ~10-15%, transition needs phase completion data already in context):

Read and follow `~/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/transition.md`, passing through the `--auto` flag so it propagates to the next phase invocation.

**If neither `--auto` nor `AUTO_CFG` is true:**

The workflow ends. The user runs `/gsd:progress` or invokes the transition workflow manually.

- **Dependency chain breaks:** Wave 1 fails → Wave 2 dependents likely fail → user chooses attempt or skip
